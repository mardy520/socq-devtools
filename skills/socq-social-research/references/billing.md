# Billing and Cost Control

Read the capability's `billing` object before submitting. Price and availability come from the live Capability Registry and can change without a Skill update.

Before a large job:

1. Call `socq_account` or `socq account`.
2. Inspect the endpoint's credits and billing unit.
3. Reduce `results_limit` or platform count when the user has not authorized a large spend.
4. Submit one representative platform first when input quality is uncertain.

API keys may have hourly and daily credit ceilings in addition to the account balance. A rate/credit limit response is not a provider failure; wait for the indicated reset or ask the user to adjust scope.
